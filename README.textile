h1. LazyPaul Plugin for jQuery

LazyPaul delays loading of images in long web pages. Images outside of viewport wont be loaded before user scrolls to them. This is opposite of image preloading.

Using LazyPaul on long web pages containing many large images makes the page load faster. Browser will be in ready state after loading visible images. In some cases it can also help to reduce server load.

LazyPaul is a fork of Mika Tuupola's Lazy Load version 1.8.1 which was inspired by "YUI ImageLoader":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imageloader/ Utility by Matt Mlinac.

h2. How to Use?

LazyPaul depends on jQuery. Include them both in end of your HTML code:

<pre><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="jquery.lazypaul.js" type="text/javascript"></script></pre>

You must alter your HTML code. Put the place holder image into src attribute. Demo pages use 1Ã—1 pixel grey gif. URL of the real image must be put into data-original attribute. It is good idea to give Lazy Loaded image a specific class. This way you can easily control which images plugin is binded to.

<pre><img class="lazy" src="img/grey.gif" data-original="img/example.jpg"  width="640" heigh="480"></pre>

then in your code do:

<pre>$("img.lazy").lazypaul();</pre>

This causes all images of class lazy to be lazy loaded.
